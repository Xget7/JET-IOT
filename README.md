# 🚀 IoT Automation Project Repository for Gates and Alarms 🚪🔒

Welcome to the repository of our exciting IoT automation project for gates, alarms, and more! Here you will find all the code and documentation related to our team's endeavor into the world of Internet of Things (IoT).

## 📋 Description
The main objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive automation system for gates, alarms, and other devices, utilizing cutting-edge IoT technologies. Our solution combines a backend implemented in **Django**, a popular web development platform, with a mobile application developed in **Kotlin** for Android devices. Additionally, we use the **ESP32** as the main microcontroller and have designed a custom PCB that includes a relay and other necessary components.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Gate remote control: You can open, close, and monitor the status of your gate from the comfort of your mobile device. 📱🚪
- Alarm system: We have implemented an alarm system that will instantly notify you of any suspicious events or intrusions. 🚨📢
- IoT integration: Our project allows for the interconnection of various devices, giving you the flexibility to expand your automation system as needed. 🌐🔌
- Django backend: We utilize Django to implement a robust backend that handles business logic, user management, and communication with IoT devices. 💻🌐
- Kotlin MVVM mobile application: The mobile application developed in Kotlin follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience. 📱💡
